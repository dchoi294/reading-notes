# Class 7 Reading Note

Who is Roy Fielding?

- REST

Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

- They weren't designed to be used like that since being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

- HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol, is applying verbs to nouns.

What does a GET do?

- Get gets all of the things the same way given a URL.

What does a POST do?

- Adding something to another system.

What does PUT do?

- Replacing something in another system.

What does PATCH do?

- A partial updaing.

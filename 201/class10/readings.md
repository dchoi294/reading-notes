# Class10 Reading Notes

## What went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language (spelling errors), and the logical error is an error in a program that causes it to operate incorrectly but not to terminate abnormally (it's correct but the code is not what you wanted to write).

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- Syntax error. During lab 9, I was wondering why my code is not working, but then I figured out that I misspelled the name of certain value.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- It will reduce failure of coding by syntax errors and logical errors which usually happens. I believe that this will save so much time during coding.

## The JavaScript Debugger

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- It is a tool that helps the software development process by figuring out coding errors.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

- It is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes.

3. What is the call stack?

- This section shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.

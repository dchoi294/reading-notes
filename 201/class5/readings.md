# Class5 Reading Notes

## HTML Media

We use *alt* in the case when the image is broken in the webpage. Normally, it shows the description of the image. The figure tag is used to semantically organize the content of images, videos, audios, or even charts or tables, block of codes in the HTML document.  
**Common Image Types**  
GIF, and SVG are the type of images. GIF is the type of image like a preview, and SVG is the type of image that will show you specifically and clearly.  
PNG would be the perfect image type for screenshots and other types of imagery where there/'s not a lot of color data.

## CSS

The foreground would be a pencil and the background would be paper where you will write with a pencil. Font styles are the properties that affect a text/'s font, which font gets applied, its size, and whether it/'s bold, italic, etc. Font-size is lieterally the size of the font, font-weight is the value placed on your font that will determine how bold or light your text will be appeared on the website. Mostly, italic text was used for the font-style.  
You can either add margin right to the first h1 tag or you can add margin left to the second h1 tag. This will make the website looks clear and clean.

## Things I want to know more about

Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character? I couldn/'t answer this question. I want to know more specifics about choosing colors and what would each color affect the website.

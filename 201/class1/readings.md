## Getting Started

HTML is the basic structure of the webpage, CSS is the style and design of the webpage, stylesheet, and JS is like a script. When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain "link" elements referencing external CSS stylesheets and "script" elements referencing external JS scripts.  
When you try to put an image into a webpage, click on the image to get an enlarged view of it and right-click the image to save or copy the image's web address from your browser's address bar.  
When you are declaring a number or string, you need to "let" name = "string", or number.  
Variables are containers that store values. "Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image displayed in an image gallery."

## Introduction to HTML

HTML is HyperText Markup Language. The Anatomy of an HTML element is the opening tag, content, and closing tag.  
The "article" and "section" element tags are similar, but "section" is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality, or a theme, while "article" encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page, for example, a single blog post.  
A "typical" website includes elements of the header, navigation bar, main content, sidebar, and footer.  
A "meta" element specifies the document's character encoding, the character set that the document is permitted to use.  
"Specifying a description that includes keywords relating to the content of your page is useful as it has the potential to make your page appear higher in relevant searches performed in search engines."

## Miscellaneous

**How to start to design a Website**  
*"Define what you want to accomplish with it"* is the all-important first step of every project. It seems obvious, but too many projects fail from a lack of goals and vision. When you want to design a website there are some important questions that you need to answer when you start planning to design the website.

- What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- How will a website help me reach my goals?
- what needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

**Semantics**  
It refers to the meaning of a piece of code. In HTML, the "h1" semantic element gives the text wrapped around the roles, meaning "a top-level heading on your page." Which, by default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an "h1" with a large font size to make it look like a heading and it can be styled however you want to be looked like. On the other hand, "span" has no semantic value, which means it will not get any extra benefits as "h1" does.

**What is JavaScript?**  
JavaScript is a "programming language used to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user". For example, it can make prompting a user with a question. JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client.  
JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. It uses "style" to add to your page.

## Things I want to know more about

*Semantics*, I want to know more about this part so that I can build a better structure of the webpage with more features and benefits of it.

## **Growth Mindset is to me**...

A pathfinder that leads to your future.

*Three Reminders to Stay In Growth Mindset*:

- Reminder 1 => Everything will eventually become a past even the time I am spending to wrtie this.
- Reminder 2 => Think of myself in the future whenever I feel like to give up or quit.
- Reminder 3 => Be afraid of same mistakes I will be able to make instead of new ones that I will make.

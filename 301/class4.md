# Class 4 Reading Notes

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?

- It is where the form's data is handled by the component's state.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.

- It won't re-render the component if we try to update the state directly.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?

- using target.value

Why would we use a ternary operator?

- To perform inline condition checkign instead of using multiple lines of if else statement.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

- let example = ((x===y) ? console.log(true)) : console.log(false);

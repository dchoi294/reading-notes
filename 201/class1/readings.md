**How to start to design a Website**  
*"Define what you want to accomplish with it"* is the all-important first step of every project. It seems obvious, but too many projects fail from lack of goals and vision. When you want to design a website there are some important questions that you need to answer when you start planning to design the website.

- What exactly do I want to accomplish?
- How will a website help me reach my goals?
- what needs to be done, and in what ordre, to reach my goals?

**Semantics**  
It refers to the meaning of a piece of code. In HTML, the "h1" semantic element gives the text wrapped around the roles, meaning of "a top level heading on your page." Which, by default, most browser's user agent stylesheet will style an "h1" with a large font size to make it look like a heading and it can be styled however you want to be looked like. On the other hand, "span" has no semantic value, which means it will not get any extra benefits like "h1" does.

**What is JavaScript?**  
JavaScript is a programming language used to creat a dynaamic and interactive experience for the user. For example, it can make prompting a user a qeustion. JavaScript dynamically generates new content inside the browser on the client.  
JavaScript is applied to your HTML page in a similar manner to CSS. It uses "style" to add into your page.

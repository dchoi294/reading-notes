## Whiteboard Advice

**Communicate!**  

The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate! This may seem like an anti-climactic piece of advice, but I hope to be able to demonstrate to you that it’s actually the most important skill to prepare prior to an interview.

**Restate the Question**  

Do you understand what they’re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

**Ask About Edge Cases and Test Cases**  

It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great — it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs. 

This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

**Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense**  

You don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.  

*Super bonus: If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code, you have actually earned a lot of points by now! Sure, in some elite companies they won’t accept anything but functional code, but simply being able to reason through the pseudocode is sufficient for many great companies.*

**Ask for Help!**  

If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally. For example:

“I’m a bit stuck here, do you have any tips to nudge me in the right direction?”
The answer might be “no, I’d like to see if you can solve it from here on your own,” but it also very well might be a “yes” with a useful tip!

*Bonus: Communicating Prior to the Interview
You should have a human resources or interview point of contact prior to the interview. Are you curious whether there will be a coding portion of the interview? Ask them! Furthermore, you can ask if there is anything in particular you should prepare. They very well might give you hints like specifying the language in which they’ll ask questions, the number of questions, the style of question (e.g., develop an algorithm vs. find the bug). They might tell you whether you’ll be sitting at a computer or standing at a whiteboard — very useful information you might be able to use to practice or, at the very least, mentally prepare.*  


## 6 Tips

**Take a few minutes**  

Speaking as an interview coach, this is one misstep that I see all the time during mock interviews. The canonical tip that everyone gives is, “talk more!”. What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.  

Wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer:

“Okay, got it. If it’s okay with you, I’m just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I’ll start talking.”

**Write down the steps of the solution**  

Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.  

**Write pseudocode first**  

Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.  

**Don’t sweat the small stuff**  

Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.  

**Sit down. Be humble**  

A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess. 

If you are given criticism in an interview, you need to take it and be grateful for it. No snide remarks, no “oh, I was gonna do that in a second anyway”, no anger or raised voice. The interviewer has their opinion, and they didn’t have to share it — they could’ve just written it down silently and rejected you as a candidate later. They’ve given you a chance to correct course because they think you’re worth it, and they’ve extended an opportunity for you to demonstrate how you accept feedback from your peers. Don’t waste it.

**Review your work**  

You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible.

Think about how silly you look if your solution is not right.

Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.

In particular, focus on these two areas, as they receive heavy scrutiny in interviews

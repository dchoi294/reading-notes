# Ethics in Tech

## Ethics in the workplace

### Google and AI

Google has announced its principles for developing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, which include avoiding projects that cause "overall harm," not building AI systems that violate "internationally accepted norms," and ensuring AI is developed and used in a way that is socially beneficial. The announcement came after Google was criticized by employees and academics for its involvement in Project Maven, a US military project that relied on open-source software. Some employees even resigned in protest, concerned that Google was aiding the development of autonomous weapons systems. The new AI principles have received mixed reactions from Google employees, with some questioning whether the principles would explicitly prohibit Google from pursuing a government contract like Maven in the future. Others praised the principles but called for more public transparency and for Google to work with the United Nations to reject autonomous weapons.

### Will democracy survive big data and AI?

The integration of big data and artificial intelligence into society and governance presents new challenges to the democratic system. The massive amount of data collected and analyzed by AI systems can potentially be used to manipulate public opinion and undermine the democratic process. The increasing reliance on AI-powered decision-making in politics and governance also raises questions about accountability and transparency. The deployment of AI technologies in the political arena may also perpetuate existing biases and perpetuate systemic inequalities. It is crucial for democratic societies to critically assess the impact of AI and big data on their institutions and to proactively regulate the use of these technologies in a manner that safeguards democratic values and principles.

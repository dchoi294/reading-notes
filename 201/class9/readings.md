# Class9 Reading Notes

## HTML Forms

1. Why are forms so important in web development?

- "Web forms are one of the main points of interaction between a user and a website or application." It allows users to enter data, which, for example, will be able to save data received from the app and store it on the web.

2. When designing a form, what are some key things to keep in mind when it comes to user experience?

- Being simple and straightforward, and arranging your form fields from easiest to hardest.

3. List 5 form elements and explain their importance.

- The "fieldset" is an element that allows us to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose for styling and semantic purposes in a convenient way.
- The text content of the "legend" formally describes the purpose of the "fieldset" it is included inside.
- The "label" element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget. It is the most important if you want to build accessible forms.

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?

- 

2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?

- The name of the event and a function to handle the event.

3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful?

- The target event property returns the element that triggered the event.

4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?

- With bubbling, the event is first captured and handled by the innermost element and then propagated to the outer elements. With capturing, the event is first captured by the outermost element and propagated to the inner elements.

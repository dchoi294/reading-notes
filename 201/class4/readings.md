# Class4 Reading Notes

## Creating Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or make apps available at a web address. <"a"> is needed to create a basic link.  
The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to.  
*What are some ways we can ensure links on our pages are accessible to all readers?*

- Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the page, and reading links out of context.
- Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good idea to include keywords in your link text.
- Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word, so their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out like links.

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow and Positioning

Normal flow is the way that webpage elements lay themselves out if you haven/'t changed their layout.
Block elements always start from a new line, and inline elements never start from a new line.  
**Static** positioning is the default for every HTML element.  
You can create isolated UI features that don/'t interfere with the layout of other elements on the page. For example, popup information boxes, control menus, and rollover panels.  
*What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?*  
An absolute positioning fixes an element in place relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, and fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion.

## Functions - Reusable Blocks of Code

The function name can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions. The function declarations are used when you want to create a function on the global scope and make it available throughout your code. The function invocation can maintain clean syntax.  
Function parameters are the names listed in the function's definition, and the function arguments are the real values passed to the function.

**6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.  
*Job interview readiness*

- Since I have no experience in doing a job interview, it would be a great opportunity to get information about a job interview.

*Learning from fellow students*  

- "Everyone has a different approach to problem solving", learning different approaches to a certain problem would definitely help me a lot so that I can learn and apply those different approaches to other problems, too.

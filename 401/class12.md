# Class 12 Reading Note

Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.  

## Object creation

- Series => Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude missing data Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their associated index valuesâ€“ they need not be the same length. The result index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.

- DataFrame => Data structure also contains labeled axes (rows and columns). Arithmetic operations align on both row and column labels. Can be thought of as a dict-like container for Series objects. The primary pandas data structure.

## Viewing data

By default, the dtype of the returned array will be the common NumPy dtype of all types in the DataFrame. For example, if the dtypes are float16 and float32, the results dtype will be float32.  

## Selection by label

Pandas provides a suite of methods in order to have purely label based indexing. This is a strict inclusion based protocol. Every label asked for must be in the index, or a KeyError will be raised. When slicing, both the start bound AND the stop bound are included, if present in the index. Integers are valid labels, but they refer to the label and not the position.

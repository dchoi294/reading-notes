# Class7 Reading Notes

## Domain Modeling

**Why do we need domain modeling?**  
"Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain"

Reference [Domain Modeling](https://github.com/codefellows/domain_modeling#domain-modeling)  

## HTML Table Basics

- Layout tables reduce accessibility for visually impaired users
- Tables produce tag soup, table layouts generally involve more complex markup structures than proper layout techniques, and it may result in the code being harder to write, maintain, and debug.
- Tables are not automatically responsive

"td" element stands for table data, which is the smallest container inside, a table cell. "tr"element stands for table row, which allows you to stop the row and placing cells on the second row. "th" element stands for table header, which is to recognize the table headers as headers.

## Introducing Constructor

To create an object and set values if there are any object, we need constructor. You don/'t need to explicitly state what to return as the constructor function since it returns the object that gets created within it by default.  
"Objects created using object literal are singletons, this means when a change is made to the object, it affects the object entire the script. Whereas if an object is created using constructor function and a change is made to it, that change won't affect the object throughout the script."

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

I do not know how to explain via analogy from my previous work experience.

## Things I want to know more about properties present

I still could not fully understand the prototypes and inheritance. I get the concept and I can explain what those are, but could not say anyhing when tried to explain those via analogy from my previous work experience.

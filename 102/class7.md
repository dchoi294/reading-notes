# Class 7 Reading Notes

**Control flow**

- the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.  
for example, conditionals and loops.
- means that when you read script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.

**JavaScript Function Syntax**

- a JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
- Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs, which are the same rules as variables.
- The parentheses may include more than one parameters by separating them by commas  
for example, (parameter1, parameter2)

function name(p1, p2, p3){  
    //code to be executed  
}

**Function Invocation**  
*The code inside the function will execute when the user or something invokes (or calls) the function*
- when an event occurs (i.g. when a user clicks a button)
- when it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
- automatically (self invoked)

**Function Return**  
When JavaScript reaches a return statement, the function will stop executing, and it will often compute a return value, and the return value is going to be "returned" back to the user (or caller).

- "Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations.

## JavaScript Operators

**JavaScript Arithmetic Operators**

- '+' => addition
- '-'  => subtraction
- '*'  => multiplication
- '**' => exponentiation
- '/'  => division
- '%' => modulus (division remainder)
- '++' => increment
- '--' => decrement

**JavaScript Assignment Operators**

- '=' => x = y   x = y
- '+=' => x += y  x = x + y
- '-=' => x -= y  x = x - y
- '*=' => x *= y  x = x * y
- '/=' => x /= y  x = x / y
- '%=' => x %= y  x = x % y
- '**=' => x **= y x = x ** y

**JavaScript Comparison Operators**

- '==' => equal to
- '===' =>equal value and equal type
- '!=' => not equal
- '!==' => not equal value or not equal type
- '>' => greater than
- '<' => less than
- '>=' =>greater than or equal to
- '<=' =>less than or equal to
- '?' =>ternary operator

**JavaScript Logical Operators**

- && => logical and
- || => logical or
- ! =>logical not

**JavaScript Type Operators**

- typeof => Returns the type of a variable
- instanceof =>Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type

**JavaScript Bitwise Operators**

- '&' => AND
- '|' => OR
- '~' => NOT
- '^' => XOR
- '<<' => left shift
- '>>' => right shift
- '>>>' => unsigned right shift

## Learn CSS - Firebox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means.  
It means that it is designed to provide greater control over alignment and space distribution between items within the container. It only deals with the layout in a single direction at a time, which will be working well for smaller layouts such as components.  
2. Explain the difference between the main axis and the cross axis.  
The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis. "The main axis is the one set by your "flex-direction" property. The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if "flex-direction is the "row" the cross axis runs along the column."
3. How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?

## Ordered and Unordered lists

Unordered lists are for grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering and ordered lists are the other way, which will have numbers or letters. Both represent a list of items. The only difference is that the ordered lists are meaningful. Unordered lists are used to create a list of related items but in no particular order. On the other hand, ordered lists are used to create a list of related items in a specific order. You can change ordered lists between numbers and letters, and the same goes for unordered lists but you can change the bullet style in the CSS.

## Learn CSS

There are two types of boxes, block boxes, and inline boxes. Boxes have an inner display type and an outer display type. In CSS, a margin is a space around an element's border, and padding is the space between an element's border and the element's content. Basically, the margin property controls the space outside an element, and the padding property controls the space inside an element.

- Content box, The area where your content is displayed.
- Padding box, sits around the content as white space.
- Borders box, wraps the content, and any padding.
- Margins box, is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and the border as whitespace between this box and other elements.

## Learn JS

**Array**  
They are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. It can store various data types like strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays.  
*Is the people array a valid JavaScript array? If so, how can I access the values stored? If not why?*  
The answer would be the error since the boolean and string cannot be added, and the same goes for between the boolean and number.

**Shortand Operators**

- "+=", it is same as x = x + f()
- "-=", it is same as x = x - f()
- "<<=", it is same as x = x << f()
- "&&=", it is same as x && (x = f())

The conditional statement can be used when you decided on something. For example, in the real world, the conditional statement would be needed in a JavaScript program, when there is a passcode to put in so that when you put the wrong passcode in, it will be returning false and not pass it.

Loop, is useful when you are doing the same thing over and over again. For example, you need to pick 100 numbers, then you can use the loop to pick numbers 100 times.

## Things I want to know more about

Can you call a specific value inside the array that is in the array?

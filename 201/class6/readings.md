# Class6 Reading Notes

## JavaScript Object Basics

Object in JavaScript is like a dish with food on it. A dish has a style such as color, design, weight, etc.  
The advantage of Object Literal is that it provides a shorter syntax for creating or initializing properties from variables. It provides a shorter syntax for defining function methods. It will enable the ability to have computed property names in an object's literal definition.  
Objects represent "things" with characteristics, and properties, while arrays create and store lists of data in a single variable.  
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage of using this?  
There are some cases in that you can't use dot notation such as when an object property name is held in a variable.  
this.name refers to "Spot" and this.age refers to "2".  
The "this" keyword allows us to reuse functions in different execution contexts, which means that a function once defined can be invoked for different objects using this keyword.

## Introduction to the DOM

DOM, Document Object Model, is "the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web." It is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the document as nodes and objects so that programming languages can interact with the page.  
JavaScript uses the DOM to access the document and its elements.

## Things I want to more about

I want to know more about how can I apply these knowledge into actual coding in real life.

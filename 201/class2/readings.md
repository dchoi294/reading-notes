# Class2 Reading Notes

## HTML

- Using semantic elements in HTML makes your code easier to understand, making the source code more readable for other developers.  
- There are six heading elemetns "h1" through "h6", and each element represents a different level of content in the document.
- The "sup" is a superscript and the "sub" is subscript "when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have th ecorrect meaning".
- The "abbr" is abbreviations, which "is used to wrap around an abbreviation or acronym. When including either, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the "abbr" to mark up the abbreviation."

## CSS

There are three ways to apply CSS to a document, with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.

- An external stylesheet is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document.
- An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document, which means that you can write the same code as an external stylesheet but inside the document with "style" element contained inside the HTML "head".
- "Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a "style" attribute." However, "You might have to resort to using inline styles if your working environment is very restrictive."

*what is representing the selector?*

- p, h1, div, span, etc.

*which components are the CSS declarations?*

- "color: blue", font-size: 12px", etc.

*which components are considered properties?*

- font-size, width, background-color, color, border, etc.

## JavaScript

Forward slash plus star makes everything in between as a comment, and double forward slash make a single line as a comment.  
**Operators**

- "+"
- "-"
- "*"
- "/"
- "="
- "!="

*Functions* are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse.  

The use of an "else if" is to specify a new condition to test, if the first statement is false.  
*3 diff types of comparison operators*

- "===" and "!==" test if one value is identical to, or not identical to, another.
- "<" and ">" test if one value is less than or greater than another.
- "<=" and ">=" test if one value is less than or equal to, or greater than or equal to, another.

*what is the difference between the logical operator "&&" and "||"?*  
In the conditional statement, if it shows "&&", then both statements must be true to return true. If one is true and other is not, then it will return false. However, "||" returns true even if one is true and the other is not.

## Things I want to know more about

- Why can't we have more than 6 headers? If I want to make more than 6 headers, can I create one if possible?
- More detail about a real world problem I can solve with a function?

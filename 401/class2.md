# Class 2 Reading Note

### TDD with Python

TDD, Test-Driven Development, is "a strategy to think tests first."  
Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output, and the behavior of your code.  
AAA:

- Arrange => you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
- Act => here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behavior)
- Assert => after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting

### If name equals main

"If the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __ name __ variable to have a value “__ main __”. If this file is being imported from another module, __ name __ will be set to the module’s name."

### Recursion

"The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function."

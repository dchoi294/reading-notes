# About My Growth Mindset

A pathfinder that leads to your future.

*Three Reminders to Stay In Growth Mindset*:

- Everything will eventually become a past even the time I am spending to wrtie this.
- Think of myself in the future whenever I feel like to give up or quit.
- Be afraid of same mistakes I will be able to make instead of new ones that I will make.

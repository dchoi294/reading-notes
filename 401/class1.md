## Pain vs. Suffering

Whatâ€™s your perspective?

- Pain is never gone, but suffering can be reduced.

Why are you doing this?

- This is my first step to build myself as a software developer.

Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?

- I would like to be able to work myself and help others easily on programming.

Are you doing this for you?

- Yes, myself is of course included among a lot of reasons I am doing this.


### Beginners Guide to Big O

"Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm."

O(1) => Describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time regardless of the size of the input data set.  
O(N) => Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.  
O(N^2) => Represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.  
O(2^N) => denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set.
